# thonny-flake
A [Thonny](https://github.com/thonny/thonny) plugin to add most of [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)'s warnings (except for [F401](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/F401.html) because Thonny already warns when imported modules are unused).

## Installing
To install from pip3 using a terminal (or Powershell for Windows users):
```bash
pip3 install thonny-flake
# Or
python3 -m pip install thonny-flake
```

To install directly from Thonny:
1. Click "Tools" and then click "Manage Plug-ins..."
2. Search for "thonny-flake" in the input box.
3. Click install.

After installing you will need to restart Thonny.
